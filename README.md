Hurricanes, Ocean Temps, and Carbon Levels

Although all scientists have yet to agree that the number of hurricanes globally is increasing due to climate change they do concurr that warmer ocean temperatures and higher sea levels are expected to increase their intensity and impacts.

This visualization allows the user to view the number of historic hurricanes over the modern era and compare these to ocean temperatures as well as atmospherice carbon levels over time. This will enable someone to view the data and reach there own conclusions or supplement them with further research.
